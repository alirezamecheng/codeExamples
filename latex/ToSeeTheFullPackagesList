You can find all locations that TeX will search for files using

kpsepath tex
The format is a bit weird: items are separated by colons, directories that should be searched using a ls-R index file start with !!, directories to be searched recursively end with //. To clean it up, we can process the output a bit:

kpsepath tex | tr ':' '\n' | perl -ne 'm-^(!!)?(/.*?)(//)?$- && print "$2\n"'
For each of those paths, you can find out which installed packages have put files under those paths using dlocate:

dlocate --package-only /path
(if you don't have dlocate, install it and make sure to run sudo update-dlocatedb). Putting it all together and eliminating duplicate package names from the output:

=============================== دستور اصلی
kpsepath tex | tr ':' '\n' | perl -ne 'm-^(!!)?(/.*?)(//)?$- && print "$2\n"' | while read path; do dlocate --package-only $path ; done | sort -u
===============================
For example, on my system, that prints:

asymptote
cm-super-minimal
context
dblatex
feynmf
gnuplot-x11
latex-beamer
latex-cjk-common
latex-make
latex-xcolor
latex2html
lgrind
lilypond-data
lmodern
pgf
preview-latex-style
tex-common
tex-gyre
tex4ht-common
texinfo
texlive-base
texlive-bibtex-extra
texlive-extra-utils
texlive-font-utils
texlive-fonts-extra
texlive-fonts-recommended
texlive-generic-recommended
texlive-lang-other
texlive-latex-base
texlive-latex-extra
texlive-latex-recommended
texlive-luatex
texlive-math-extra
texlive-metapost
texlive-pictures
texlive-pstricks
texlive-science
texlive-xetex
texpower

There's some stuff there that I wouldn't have expected, like gnuplot-x11, but dpkg -L shows that it includes a gnuplot-lua-tikz.sty. Who knew?!
